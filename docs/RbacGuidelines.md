Here's a schema for the SQLite RBAC system, structured in a way that outlines how an LLM can generate the necessary features and logic based on the schema and requirements:

### RBAC Database Schema Outline

#### 1. **Departments Table**
Stores the different departments within the organization.

| Column        | Type    | Constraints     |
|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| `id`          | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT |
| `name`        | TEXT    | UNIQUE, NOT NULL |

- **Purpose**: Identifies departments, such as *Serendipity*, *Dhoomstudios*, and *Trademan*.

#### 2. **Roles Table**
Stores the various roles that users can have within each department.

| Column        | Type    | Constraints     |
|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| `id`          | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT |
| `name`        | TEXT    | UNIQUE, NOT NULL |

- **Purpose**: Manages roles like *Admin*, *Manager*, *Executive*, and *Public*.

#### 3. **Permissions Table**
Stores the permissions that are available for assignment to roles.

| Column        | Type    | Constraints     |
|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| `id`          | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT |
| `name`        | TEXT    | UNIQUE, NOT NULL |

- **Purpose**: Defines permissions like *scrape*, *analyze*, *coding_outline*, *generate_copy*, etc.

#### 4. **Role Permissions Table**
Maps which permissions are available for each role within a department.

| Column           | Type    | Constraints                      |
|------------------|---------|----------------------------------|
| `department_id`  | INTEGER | FOREIGN KEY (references departments.id) |
| `role_id`        | INTEGER | FOREIGN KEY (references roles.id) |
| `permission_id`  | INTEGER | FOREIGN KEY (references permissions.id) |
| **Primary Key**  | (`department_id`, `role_id`, `permission_id`) |

- **Purpose**: Specifies the access control rules by mapping roles within departments to their allowed permissions.

#### 5. **Users Table**
Stores user information and their associated department and role.

| Column           | Type    | Constraints                          |
|------------------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| `id`             | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT          |
| `email`          | TEXT    | UNIQUE, NOT NULL                    |
| `name`           | TEXT    | NULLABLE                            |
| `department_id`  | INTEGER | FOREIGN KEY (references departments.id) |
| `role_id`        | INTEGER | FOREIGN KEY (references roles.id)   |

- **Purpose**: Holds user details and maps them to a department and a role.

### Features Outline for LLM

This outline serves as a guide for implementing various features and functionalities using the database schema. Each feature will leverage the schema to enforce and manage permissions dynamically.

#### Feature 1: **User Login and Mapping**
   - **Input**: User email and token (via Google SSO)
   - **Action**: Check if the user exists in the `users` table. If not:
     - Assign the user a default role (e.g., *Public*).
     - Associate them with a default department (e.g., *Serendipity*).
     - Insert the user into the database.
   - **Output**: Return user information and their associated permissions.

#### Feature 2: **Role Permission Check**
   - **Input**: User email, requested permission
   - **Action**:
     - Retrieve the user’s department and role.
     - Fetch the permissions allowed for this role within the department from `role_permissions`.
     - Check if the requested permission is present.
   - **Output**: Boolean indicating if the user has access.

#### Feature 3: **Automatic Role Assignment for New Users**
   - **Input**: User email during login (SSO)
   - **Action**:
     - If the email does not match any predefined users, assign the *Public* role and a default department.
   - **Output**: Insert or update the user’s information in the database.

#### Feature 4: **Admin Dashboard for Role and Permission Management**
   - **Input**: Admin credentials, new roles, or permissions
   - **Action**:
     - Admin can add, update, or remove roles and permissions.
     - Admin can assign users to roles and departments.
   - **Output**: Updated database records reflecting the changes.

#### Feature 5: **Department-Specific Access Control**
   - **Input**: User login and department context
   - **Action**: Validate that the user has access to features specific to their department by checking the `role_permissions` table.
   - **Output**: Permission granted or denied response based on the user’s role within the department.

#### Feature 6: **Logging and Auditing Access Requests**
   - **Input**: User email and accessed feature
   - **Action**: Log each access request to a logging table (if added) for audit purposes. This can also include logging unauthorized access attempts.
   - **Output**: Insert logs into a `access_logs` table (if created).

By following this schema and feature outline, an LLM can generate the necessary code and logic to implement and manage an RBAC system efficiently. This approach ensures scalability and security while managing access permissions based on the defined rules and structure.
